 Infinite Skills: If you had infinite programming skills, what would you build? You’re about to learn how to program. If you have an end goal in mind, you’ll have an immediate use for your new skills; now is a great time to write brief descriptions of what you want to create. It’s a good habit to keep an “ideas” notebook that you can refer to whenever you want to start a new project. Take
a few minutes now to describe three programs you want to create

one program I would love to create if I had infinite skills would be a Password skimmer (for ethical reasons) it would be a program
that I would enter a username and it skims across tons of databases and sites to find keyphrases and words that the username is 
tied to 

my next program would be a elite gaming marco hopefully run by some sort of ai to track what task needs to be done next, so if im 
playing a game that involves beating up bandits to level up then the marco would track the nearest bandit and fight them

my last and final use of my newly found infinite skill would be a key logger that tracks every other player in my video game lobby 
with me being able to see there key strokes and seeing there go to keys I would be able to counter them in the next round!
